# GROOT: Generating Robust Watermark for Diffusion-Model-Based Audio Synthesis

------
### Installation Dependencies:
1. Installing anaconda and python (our version == 3.8.10).
2. Creating the new environment for Groot and install the requirements.
   ~~~
   conda create -n Groot python=3.8
   conda activate Groot
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ~~~

### Pretrained Models
Downloading the pretrained models and place them into `pretrain/`.

Pretrained models can be downloaded at [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JTxQvPA-nnhVzMTh5wwwUtMMCT-fQVPg).

### Generative Model
As the paper described, we provide [Diffwave](https://github.com/lmnt-com/diffwave) as the diffusion model.

The pretrained model of DiffWave can be downloaded at [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JTxQvPA-nnhVzMTh5wwwUtMMCT-fQVPg) and please also place it into `pretrain/`.
